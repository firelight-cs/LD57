## The Game
https://n1evsky.itch.io/there-is-a-light
The game was made for a LUDUM DARE 57 game jam in 48 hours (compo mode).
Unfortunately, 10 hours were spent on actual development. The result is not satisfactory, but I liked the mechanics with the transmission of light. With sufficient polishing, the game could have turned out much better. But I got what I deserved.

p.s. web build destroyed sounds :(
